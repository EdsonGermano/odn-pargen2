# Data originates at http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/elsi/tableGenerator.aspx and is provided by the National Center for Education Statistics
#
NOTES: CBSA downloads don't have a FIPS ID, but we could do a fuzzy search to resolve them. We proceed w/ States and Counties for our first pass.

1. Downloading statistics data

Download 2 files separately for State and County. Choose the Select a Table Row in the tableGenerator.

2. For each region type, select the past X years of data such that data exists for every year for all region types (12 as of March 2016). Choose the Select Years.

3. For each region type, select the FIPS code or id (in the county case) so that the USCensusID can be generated.

4. + Pupil/Teacher Ratio across time

5. open and delete non header lines

6. the ELSI site generates anomolies in the data, such as selective use of quotes and the 'g' char around FIPS codes. These need to be manually stripped.

7. run python script

python pag.py

8+ Proceed to upload dataset into ODN per this doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WUv2fIyj3G-7L5aCPrCTzsPXBJ44_7z6pvj9ALlQWGc
